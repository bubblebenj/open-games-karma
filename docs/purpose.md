This project serve several purposes:

- Design needs
  - From development POV
    - Simple (Not long to implement) and easy enough to iterate quickly.
    - Mobil first: The game should be available for mobile first and should support offline mode this PWA is a good lead on the matter.
  
  - From UX POV:
    - 5 Minutes short play game I call cigarette game:  
      A play should last up to 5 minutes or can be interrupted and resumed quickly.
    
- Technological intelligence:

  There are few domain that I would like to investigate:
  - React+redux: update the world using reactive propramming
  - Go langage not sure how to use this one yet
  - Fully test the GitHub capabilities:
      
  I've met a GitHub salesman that was trolling about Bitbucket and Atlassian more generally.
  So I'd like to how project management and GitHub flow is so better than Atlassian one.
  Maybe it's awesome, probably just troll, I just need to make my mind on the topic.
  
- Open Game management:
  
  I'd like to see what I can get from an open game development project.
  Not sure how and if I want other poeple to contribute.
  Anyway I'll deal with that later.
